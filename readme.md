# Advent Of Code

My solutions to the puzzles presented during the [Advent of Code][adventofcode] 2017 coding competition.

I am using these puzzles to help myself gain familiarity with Kotlin. As such, I expect some of my solutions will misuse the the Kotlin standard library in some shape or form.

All solutions were written and compiled with the Kotlin plugin bundled with the community edition of the [IntelliJ IDEA][intellij] IDE.

# Advent Of Code 2017

My solutions to the puzzles presented during the [Advent of Code][adventofcode] 2017 coding competition.

I am using these puzzles to help myself gain familiarity with Kotlin. As such, I expect that some of my solutions may misuse the the Kotlin standard library in some shape or form.

All solutions were written and compiled with the Kotlin plugin that is bundled with the community edition of the [IntelliJ IDEA][intellij] IDE.
